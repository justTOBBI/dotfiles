# Scripts

There are four scripts i use for my polybar
three scipts are taken from [voidrice](https://www.github.com/Lukesmithxyz/voidrice) of Lukesmith and modified it for my purpose

- memory (used to know memory usage)
- diskusage (used to know disk usage)
- network (To know whehter net is connected and to know the speed in %)
- sblt ( My own script to know whether the bluetooth is connected)
